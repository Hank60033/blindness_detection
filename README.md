## Problem Statement
Millions of people suffer from diabetic retinopathy, the leading cause of blindness among working aged adults. Aravind Eye Hospital in India hopes to detect and prevent this disease among people living in rural areas where medical screening is difficult to conduct. So they set up a competition on kaggle.com for competitors to build model which can help ophthalmologists to identify potential patients.

## Evaluate metrix
Quadratic weighted kappa, which measures the agreement between true labels and predicted results.

## Models
* simple CNN model(4 conv layers, 2 fc layers)
* resnet50
* efficientnetb3
